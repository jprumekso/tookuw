# Tookuw

I chalenge myself to build a complete state-based UI app using vanilla JS, then this is it: Tookuw **a simple state-based point of sale built with Bootstrap and vanilla JS.** It's still prototype though, no database whatsoever.

## Features
Here are what you can do with this simple UI:
- **Search catalog** by typing out the name of product in catalog search bar
- **Add item to receipt** by clicking item in catalog
- **Update receipt item's quantity** by clicking the plus/minus button at each receipt item. Alternatively, you can click on the quantity and Tookuw will show you a quantity modal, then type out your quantity there. 
- **Apply a discount** by typing out the discount amount then click Apply Discount
- **Assign customer** to receipt by clicking the user (with plus) icon. Also, you can filter existing customer and create the new one.
- **Proceed to \[fake\] checkout** by clicking CHARGE then Tookuw will show you a Payment Modal where you can input the amount of received payment and select the payment method. It won't process the payment though, it's only for transaction recording purpose.
- **Animated alert** consist of warning and succesful alert 
- **Payment loader screen** which simulate a payment processing.
- **Responsive!**

## Roadmap
Some plan I have with this project:
- Finish the other screens: Receipts, Products, Customer, Setting
- Adopt component-based or object-oriented style
- Client-side router
- QR Code scanner
- Turn into offline-first PWA
- Connect/deploy it to JAMSTACK backend such as Firebase/Netlify
- User Auth
