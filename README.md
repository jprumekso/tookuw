# Tookuw

I chalenge myself to build a complete state-based UI app using vanilla JS. Then here it is Tookuw **a simple state-based point of sale built with Bootstrap and vanilla JS.**

## Features
Here are what you can do with this simple UI:
- Search catalog by **typing out the name of product in catalog search bar**
- Add item to receipt by **clicking item in catalog**
- Update the quantity by **clicking the plus/minus button at each receipt item**. Alternatively, you can **click on the quantity and Tookuw will show you a quantity modal**, then type out your quantity there. 
- Apply a discount by **typing out the discount amount then click Apply Discount**
